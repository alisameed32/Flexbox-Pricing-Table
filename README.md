Project Objective:

This project creates a responsive pricing table using HTML and CSS Flexbox. The design dynamically adjusts based on screen size to maintain visual appeal and readability. On desktop screens, the pricing plans align horizontally in a row, while on smaller screens, they stack vertically to improve accessibility. The layout mimics the example provided, with distinct "Basic," "Standard," and "Premium" plan options, each featuring a plan title, price, features, and a "Sign Up" button.
